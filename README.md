This project is based on a book ***Flutter apprentice*** by **Mike Katz, Kevin D Moore & Vincent Ngo**.

* **Column** and **Row** widgets are like **ListView** but without the scroll view
* it is good to set `primary: false` if a **ListView** is not the scrollable one - in this case also add `physics: const NeverScrollableScrollPhysics()` setting to the same **ListView**
